# shinyDTC - Simple Dynamic Timer Control

A dynamic timer control is a Shiny widget that enables time-based processes in applications. 
It allows users to execute these processes manually in individual steps or at customizable speeds. 
The timer can be paused, resumed, or restarted. This control is particularly well-suited for simulations, 
animations, countdowns, or interactive visualizations.
